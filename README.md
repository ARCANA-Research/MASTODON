# MASTODON
Memory Array Simulation Testbed for Organization, Data, Operations, and Networks

MASTODON is a multi-stack-level simulator of memory and processing-using-memory architectures. MASTODON is maintained by the ARCANA Research Group at the University of Illinois (https://arcana.cs.illinois.edu/).

*This is an early release of MASTODON. Several features are still under development.*

## Components
